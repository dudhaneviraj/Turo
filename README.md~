Famework Used:Flask Rest Framework
Front-end Technologies: HTML5, CSS, jquery, Ajax, free bootstrap theme from bootswatch

Technique:
1. Get form data.
2. Ajax call to rest controller.
3. make Http call from controller to hotwire API.
4. Return data from REST API to front end in json form.
5. Parse json in javascript and render using table.


Note: I wanted to make Ajax calls directly from front end api to hotwire but couldnt do so due to Cross domain restrictions
